# Red-Grabber

A simple Python CLI application to download videos from *certain* tube websites in bulk using bookmarks in Firefox using yt-dlp.

## Description

This project started as a simple way for me to download and hoard video files from adult tube sites.

The application will attempt to download a video file using links supplied via Firefox Bookmarks exported into JSON, using yt-dlp.

### Installing

* Update the contents of the `testconfig.py` file.
* Rename `testconfig.py` to `config.py`.

### Using Red-Grabber

* Create a new folder in your Firefox bookmarks. 
* Add any links from supported tube sites to the new folder.
* Backup your bookmarks as JSON file using the name and location in `config.py`.
* Navigate to the directory containing Red-Grabber and run the following command:
